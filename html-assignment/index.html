            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I do not know how to start this, so I will just list things about me. I have a few hobbies, the three big and expensive hobbies I take part in are: Lego, Pokemon card collection, and 3d printing. I own over four thousand cards. I also like to go camping, I go once a year, the type of camping I take part in is 
Backpacking. I do read a lot, to the point where I have a book in my bag, and on my phone I am usually reading.</p>
            <p> Some other things about me are, I like to play board games and card games, mainly card games. As I said in the previous paragraph I own and play pokemon TCG. Some of my favourite card and board games are Sequence, Cribbage, Skip-bo, Scythe, and Catan. I also doodle, and carry a sketch book on me.</p>
            <p> Some interesting things about me that are not hobbies or things I like to do for fun are. I have had surgery done for tumor removal. As well as atrocious eyesight. I am an older brother, and I am a December baby.</p>
