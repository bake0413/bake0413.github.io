        <p>Hi, I do not know how to start this, so I will just list things about me. I have a few hobbies, the three big and expensive hobbies I take part in are: Lego, pokemon card collection, and 3d printing. I also like to go camping, I go once a year, the type of camping I take part in is 
Backpacking. I do read a lot, to the point where I have a book in my bag, and on my phone I am usually reading.</p>
